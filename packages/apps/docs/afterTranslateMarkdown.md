# oops... The Future of Blockchain is the Smart Contract Sharing Economy

### oops... How Kadena’s stack turns cost centers into revenue generators

**[oops... Kadena](http://kadena.io)**oops...  is uniquely positioned in the blockchain
ecosystem; we provide a complete blockchain stack allowing entrepreneurs and
developers to use both permissioned and permission-less (private and public)
blockchains to unlock new sources of revenue. Interoperating and securing our
end to end stack sits [oops... Pact](http://pact.kadena.io)oops...  — a single, simple,
integrated (and [oops... open source](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact)oops... ) smart contract
language. Kadena users effectively have an out-of-the-box solution, seamlessly
moving between public and private configurations depending on their tolerance
and case needs for permissions and security. This technology carves out new
opportunities with existing data and workflows that the current solutions
cannot. The Kadena stack \*\*turns cost centers into revenue makers. \*\*Kadena
allows companies to safely monetize their existing business workflows and
represent them as smart contracts on a public network.
