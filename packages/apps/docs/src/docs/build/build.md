# Documentation for smart contract authors and application builders

Building applications to run on a blockchain doesn't have to be hard, time-consuming, or expensive. 
Get started with the basics through hands-on tutorials. 
Learn how to set up a development network, create and fund a development wallet, deploy a smart contract, and more. 

## Onboard

If you want to experiment with interacting with a public blockchain, try the introductory applications in [Explore the blockchain](/build/onboard).
These applications enable you to explore the blockchain as a user and see blockchain activity as it happens.
In the onboarding experience, you'll:

- Add your name to the Kadena blockchain.
- View transactions in the block explorer.
- Create an account wallet.
- Fund the account wallet.
- Play and score points.

You can also follow the links in the documentation to explore the source code for each of these blockchain applications.

## Get started

When you're ready to start building, take the first step with the developer [Quick start](/build/quickstart) or [Deploy your first contract](/build/deploy-first-contract) to set up a development environment, write a simple contract, and deploy your first smart contract on a local blockchain network.
In the Quick start, you'll learn how to:

- Set up the development environment on a local computer.
- Deploy a simple "Hello, World!" smart contract on the development network.
- Read data from a smart contract without incurring transaction fees.
- Modify and update a deployed smart contract.

## Coach

If you're a developer ready to take your game to the next level, explore Kadena tools, sample code, and how-to guides in the following topics:

- Smart contracts
- Non-fungible token marketplace
- Frontend libraries and command-line interface
