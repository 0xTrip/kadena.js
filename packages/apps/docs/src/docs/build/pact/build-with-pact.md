# Build with Pact

Pact is a human-readable smart contract language. 
It allows anyone to write clearly, directly, and safely onto a blockchainâ€”a true innovation for secure and simple smart contract development. 
Pact will enable you to create entirely new business models and on-chain services.

Follow the tutorials in the Pact developer beginner series to learn the Pact programming
language using the documentation and complimentary videos for each lesson.

The [beginner series](/build/pact/beginner) covers fundamental concepts with simple examples to illustrate common activities and give you practice using the language in realistic scenarios.

After you complete the beginner series, explore [Real World Pact](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/real-world-pact) tutorials and commented Pact code to learn how to write real-world smart contracts including a testnet faucet and a DeFi lending platform.
