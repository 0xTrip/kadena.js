# Build with Pact

Pact is a human-readable smart contract language. 
It allows anyone to write clearly, directly, and safely onto a blockchain—a true innovation for secure and simple smart contract development. 
Pact will enable you to create entirely new business models and on-chain services.

Follow the tutorials in the Pact developer beginner series to learn the Pact programming
language using the documentation and complimentary videos for each lesson.

The [beginner series](/build/pact/beginner) covers fundamental concepts with simple examples to illustrate common activities and give you practice using the language in realistic scenarios.

After you complete the beginner series, explore [Real World Pact](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/real-world-pact) tutorials and commented Pact code to learn how to write real-world smart contracts including a testnet faucet and a DeFi lending platform.

## More resources for learning Pact

- [Deploy "Hello, World!" _ Quick start](/build/quickstart) introduces blockchain and Kadena concepts for new developers using a simple "Hello, World!" smart contract you can deploy on a local development network.
- [Pact developer tutorials](/tutorials) provide step-by-step examples and workshops from fundamental concepts to advanced topics:
- [Pact local queries](/build/guides/pact-local-api-queries) demonstrate how to use local API endpoints to test smart contracts using Mainnet data (community contribution).
- [Safe rotate and drain](/build/guides/safe-rotate-and-drain)(example) demonstrates how to rotate an account’s key and transfer the account balance to another account (xommunity contribution).
- [Safe transfer](/build/guides/safe-transfer) (example) demonstrates how to perform a safe transfer by requiring the recipient to also sign and return some KDA in a single transaction (community contribution).
