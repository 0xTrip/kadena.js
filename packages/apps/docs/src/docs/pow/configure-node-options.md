# Configure node options

Computers that run the Chainweb consensus protocol—by installing and managing the `chainweb-node` software—provide the resources that power the Kadena public blockchain network. 
By installing and running `chainweb-node` and connecting to the Kadena testnet or mainnet network, you can extend the peer-to-peer communication infrastructure and have direct access to the blockchain state.
You can help improve and security and scalability of the network just by participating.
You can also earn rewards if you choose to add resources to calculate proof-of-work solutions to validate transactions as a miner.
