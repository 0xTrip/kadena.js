- Repositories in [kadena-io](https://github.com/kadena-io) are focused on the Kadena network infrastructure and foundational components like [chainweb-node](https://github.com/kadena-io/chainweb-node) and [pact](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact).

- Repositories in [kadena-community](https://github.com/kadena-community) are focused on tooling and projects to help developers build applications on the Kadena network like the TypeScript libraries in [kadena.js](https://github.com/kadena-community/kadena.js).

For more information about contributing to the codebase, you should browse the repositories and corresponding README files.
