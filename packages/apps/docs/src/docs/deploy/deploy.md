There are two main deployment scenarios for the Kadena network:

- Deploying Pact modules and smart contracts on a network.
- Deploying and managing a node to support the network infrastructure and earn rewards.

This part of the documentation covers both scenarios and includes information for two distinct audiences:

- Smart contract developers planning to deploy contracts on the Kadena test network or the Kadena main network.
- Node operators planning to deploy and manage Chainweb nodes.
