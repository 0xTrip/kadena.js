# Non-Fungible Policy

With the
[Non-Fungible Policy](https://github.com/kadena-io/marmalade/blob/v2/pact/concrete-policies/non-fungible-policy/non-fungible-policy-v1.pact)
we step into a realm where all forms of art are as distinct as a fingerprint,
where once materialised, they maintain their individual identity. This sphere is
where Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) come to life.

## Crafting your Exclusive Masterpiece

The beginning of your journey involves conceiving your NFT, a digital
representation of your creativity. See yourself as a sculptor, your NFT, your
piece of art. With the Non-Fungible Policy, your masterpiece gets an impervious
shield, protecting it from duplication or destruction.

This process, referred to as "minting," is like bringing your unique digital
artwork into existence. You hold the reins of this progression, with the outcome
being a piece standing in its category, akin to the unmatched sculptures of
Michelangelo.

In simple terms, the Non-Fungible Policy is the golden rule that puts a seal on
the originality of your digital creation. As you 'mint', or form, your item,
this policy guarantees its individuality. Whether it's a piece of digital art or
a rare online collectible, the policy ensures that the authenticity of your
creation remains uncontested.

By integrating the Non-Fungible Policy with your digital creation (by adding the
policy to the
**[policies](https://github.com/kadena-io/marmalade/blob/v2/pact/ledger.pact#L201C20-L201C20)**
field at token creation), you provide a firm foundation that supports its
originality. The policy acts as a protective barrier (a guard), confirming that
your digital item, once born, remains solitary in its existence.
