The long-awaited release of Marmalade’s V2 standard has arrived, bringing a host
of exciting updates and features to the top NFT standard in the industry! If
you’ve been tracking the progress of Kadena and its NFT standards, you know
we’ve been on a journey from the unstandardised on-chain metadata and
single-policy token logic in V1 (KIP-13) to a far more robust and dynamic V2
(KIP-20). We’re thrilled to share the next stage of this adventure.

# What is Marmalade?

Marmalade is an NFT smart contract system on Kadena’s blockchain. It comprises
multiple smart contracts that execute logic configured by the token policies
with which the token is built. Marmalade has been in action for several years,
and now we’ve diligently upgraded to Marmalade V2, introducing an entirely new
system that simplifies the process of engaging with NFTs.

## How are tokens configured?

In Marmalade V2, every token must include a field called
[**policies**](/docs/marmalade/architecture/policies). These policies act as
foundational attributes of the token, reflecting its inherent traits. Once set
during the creation of the token, these policies become immutable and cannot be
altered. However, it's worth noting that these policies are based on smart
contracts. So, if the underlying contract is designed to be upgradable, the
policy can be updated accordingly.

With the release of Marmalade V2, we've introduced a significant enhancement:
the ability to stack multiple policies. This departs from previous version where
tokens were each limited to a single policy. With the help of
[**policy manager**](/docs/marmalade/architecture/policy-manager) in V2, a token
can be associated with multiple policies, offering an unprecedented degree of
flexibility and functionality.

## What is a concrete policy?

Marmalade V2 aims to broaden its audience by providing a tool to simplify the
token creation process, offering a set of policies that encompass commonly used
token features, referred to as
[**concrete policies**](/docs/marmalade/concrete-policies). These are 4 primary
policies written and maintained by Kadena, and token creators simply need to
pick the policies with desired features, without previous knowledge in Pact.

If projects wish to incorporate customized logic alongside the basic features
offered by concrete policies, they can also include their own policies.

## What is the metadata standard of Marmalade Tokens?

Marmalade V2 introduces an off-chain URI with a standardized metadata format,
opening the door for marketplaces to easily fetch necessary data. Read more

The evolution from V1 to V2 signifies our relentless commitment to make NFTs
more secure, flexible, and beneficial for everyone involved — creators, buyers,
and the broader community. While we loved the idea of everyone minting their own
marketplace in V1, we realized that the true strength lies in the policy
management.

As we delve into this new and exciting journey, remember that this is just the
beginning. We’re looking forward to the innovative ways that you, the builders
and pioneers, will harness the power of Marmalade V2 to create a dynamic, more
inclusive, and ever-evolving NFT landscape.
