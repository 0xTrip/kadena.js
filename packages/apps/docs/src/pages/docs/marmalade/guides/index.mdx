# Minting with Marmalade V2 Tutorial

Welcome to the Minting with Marmalade V2 tutorial! Marmalade is a revolutionary
NFT marketplace infrastructure built on the Kadena blockchain. It offers 100%
on-chain transactions, high-quality provenance, low gas fees, and shared
ownership that can span platforms. Marmalade is designed to handle the security,
scalability, and future-proofing of your NFT marketplace, allowing you to focus
on your offering, audience, and revenue.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating and minting an NFT
on Marmalade using the Chainweaver development tool. Chainweaver is a blockchain
wallet and development environment created by Kadena, which allows you to
interact with the Kadena blockchain in a user-friendly way.

Let's get started!

**Step 1: Authenticate and Locate Marmalade v2 in Chainweaver**

To begin, you need to authenticate on Chainweaver. Once you're authenticated,
navigate to the Module Explorer to find the Marmalade v2 contracts.

In the Module Explorer, search for the following string:

```
marmalade-v2.ledger
```

This will locate the Marmalade v2 contracts.

Once you find the contracts, click on "View" to proceed.

**Step 2: Create a Token ID**

`token-id`'s in marmalade are hash value of the token information, such as
the uri, policies, precision, and creation guard.
You can create the token-id by clicking on the `create-token-id` function,
and filling in the token components listed below

1. **Precision**: Enter `0`, just like you did when creating the token ID.
2. **URL**: Use the same URI you used when creating the token ID. In our
   example, it was `your-token-uri`.
3. **Policies**: In this field you can add some of the default or custom
   policies that you want to apply to the token. We'll be using an utility function
   , `marmalade-v2.util-v1.create-policies` to create a `DEFAULT` setting token.
   The DEFAULT refers to tokens with policies, `non-fungible-policy` and `guard-policy`,
   which allows token-owners to add guards for marmalade functions, and
   enforce that token is one and only.
4.**creation-guard**: This guard is not stored but is used to reserve the
  `token-id`. The guard is required to sign at creation.

We are not going to submit this transaction, because what we need is the string
value from the `Preview`.
If you click `Next` until you see a `Submit button`, you'll see the token ID
in the preview section. In our example, the `token-id` is `t:YMO4JzGYoQdIIDJHLoGDdOo-Cyin3oCqncT__MAe2qw`.

**Step 3: Create a Token**

Once  creating a token ID, the next step is to create a token. You can do this
by calling the `create-token` function.

You can find this function in the same menu as the `create-token-id` function.
Click on "Call" to bring up a similar popup as before. In the Parameters screen,
you'll need to enter the following information:

1. **Token ID**: Fill in the token-id created in step 2.
2. **Precision**: Enter `0`, just like you did when creating the token ID.
3. **URL**: Use the same URI you used when creating the token ID. In our
   example, it was `your-token-uri`.
4. **Policies**: Again, we'll use util-v1.DEFAULT as our token policies.

 **Note:** For more information on token policies, please refer to the
 [Marmalade V2 Token Policies](https://github.com/kadena-io/marmalade/tree/v2#token-policies)
 documentation on GitHub.

Next, go to the Configuration tab. Like last time, paste your account name and
change the gas settings to match the screenshot below.

In the same tab, click on "Advanced" and add a new keyset. In the field, please
enter `mint_guard` and hit "Create".

**Mint Guard**: Mint Guards are an optional field that one of our policies, `guard-policy-v1`
takes in. By adding a `mint-guard` at creation, you're adding a guard that needs to be signed
at token minting.

Once this is created, you will see your keysets below it. Please tick the keyset that matches
the account we have been using for this entire process.

Then, you can go to the Sign tab and follow the same steps as before.

Finally, go to the Preview tab and submit your transaction if there are no
errors. This time, we're submitting the transaction, so you'd need a valid gas payer with balance.
Wait for the transaction to finish. The server result should be true.

**Step 4: Mint the Token**

The final step is to mint the token. You can do this by calling the `mint`
function.

![Screenshot Placeholder](/assets/marmalade/02-mint-token-01.png)

You can find this function in the same menu as the previous functions. Click on
"Call" to bring up a popup. In the Parameters screen, you'll need to enter the
following information, each on a separate line:

1. **Token ID**: This is the token ID you received in Step X.
2. **Account Address**: This is the address of the account you have been using.
3. **Guards**: Copy and paste `(read-keyset "account")` into this field.
4. **Amount**: Set this to `1.0` as this is an NFT.

Next, navigate to the Configuration tab. As before, paste your account name in
the relevant field and check the gas settings. Also, the guard we created should
have carried over, please check this on the Advanced tab.

Now, navigate to the Sign tab. This time, things will be slightly different. We
need to add new capabilities. On the Grant Capabilities section, there is a plus
button on the right-hand side. Click that to add the first one. Please paste the
following into the first field:

```pact
(marmalade-v2.ledger.MINT "{TOKEN_ACCOUNT_IN_QUOTES}" "{RECIEVER_ACCOUNT IN QUOTES}" 1.0)
```

You need to choose a key that you've saved as `mint_guard` at step 3, and sign with that key
for successful mint.

Again, go to the Preview tab and submit your transaction if there are no
errors!
